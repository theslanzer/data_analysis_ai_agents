# **Data Analysis Report**

## **Dataset Overview**

The dataset contains transactional data related to customer purchases and interactions with a retail or service company. Here are some key aspects:

- **Data Columns:**
  - Numerical Features: Income, MntWines, MntFruits, ..., NumWebVisitsMonth, Z_CostContact, Z_Revenue, Age, Customer_Days, MntTotal, MntRegularProds.
  - Categorical Features: Kidhome, Teenhome, AcceptedCmp3 to AcceptedCmp5, AcceptedCmp1, ...
  - Binary Feature: Response.

- **Data Types:**
  - Most columns are of integer data type.
  - The 'Income' column is of float type.

- **Potential Use Cases:**
  - Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
  - Predicting future purchases.
  - Identifying high-value customers ('Income' column).
  - Analyzing marketing campaign effectiveness (AcceptedCmpX columns).
  - Managing customer complaints.

## **Data Cleaning Summary**

### Missing Data
No missing values were detected in the dataset.

### Outliers
Some numerical columns have outliers. For instance:
- Income: [216089.34, ...]
- MntWines: [5737.99, ...]

### Cleaning Steps
- Outliers were removed using the IQR method for numerical columns.
- Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding.

## **Recommendations**

1. **Further Analysis:**
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
   - Visualize distributions of numerical features, examine correlations between columns, and create heatmaps or cluster maps for categorical features.

2. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Depending on specific goals, consider tasks such as classification (e.g., predicting high-value customers) or regression (e.g., predicting future purchases).

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Consider feature scaling or normalization for numerical columns to improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.
   - Evaluate the use of dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for handling multicollinearity.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as AUC-ROC for classification tasks and MSE/RMSE for regression tasks.
   - Consider using techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting and ensure model generalizability.
